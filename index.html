      <div class="bio-content-block">
        <p>
        Currently a fourth year student in graphic design at ECV Bordeaux - School of visual communication - opening up to the world is a real asset in the purview of graphic arts to my mind, that is why I am looking for an internship abroad. This would allow me to acquire very interesting complementary knowledge regarding the continuation of my studies and to learn things with a new eye. My thirst for discovery and learning, my love for graphic arts and my keen interest in languages are vectors of my motivation. I passed the Cambridge English First certificate as well as an equivalence in Spanish. I have already done an internship in Brazil at Qu4rto Studio, a mean to learn Portuguese and a beautiful human and professional experience that I would love to renew !
        </p>
        <p>Serious, dynamic and passionate, I have a great desire to carry out all my projects and to invest myself fully in them. I am fascinated by all which concerned the creation and the innovation, as well visual arts (drawing, photography, cinema, design, painting ..), as music and travel. Good mood and crushes make my everyday life. Creativity and curiosity are my attributes. Very involved in my studies, I am a dynamic person, practicing dance and combat sports. In our time I think is good to learn about everything, that is why I am eager to learn more every day in all possible areas. Help me to fulfill my desires and to stir up my passion, and if it is your heart's desire, contact me! You will find in the Gallery section some of my achievements. Hoping to have given you the desire to leave your eyes hanging out...

          </div>
          <p>Over the years, thanks to my studies and my experience, I developed a particular taste for <a href="visualidentity.html">visual identity</a>. The many projects I realized over the last four years have allowed me to learn about branding and to visualize in a broad sense the visual communication that can be adapted to all types of media. </p>

          <h5>Illustration</h5>

          <a href="illustration.html"><img src="css/image/illu/07.jpg" alt=""></a>
          </div>
          <p>I have always liked <a href="illustration.html">illustration</a>, it allowed me to express myself in many of my projects by bringing a more personal touch. It is a technique I would never tire of.</p>

          <h5>Photography</h5>

          </div>
          <p>My love for <a href="photography.html">photography</a> was passed on to me by my father, and as long as I can remember, I always had a camera in my hands. It is for me one of the most beautiful ways to capture the moment, to hang emotions, to transmit a message.</p>
